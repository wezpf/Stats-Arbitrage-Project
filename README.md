# 📈 Statistical Arbitrage Engine (KO vs. PEP)

This project builds a **statistical arbitrage trading strategy** using pair trading on Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), implemented in Python from scratch.

It is designed as a **day-by-day build** to showcase not just the final strategy, but the thought process, model logic, and professional execution standards used in quantitative trading.
